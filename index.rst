   Scheduling simulations currently use ESO's skycalc software to pre-calculate sky brightness for the survey. The current storage format, healpix maps of the sky sampled every few minutes, results in inconveniently large files of cached data. Here, I present an exploration of the use of Zernike polynomial coefficients as an alternative.

Summary
=======

#. Sky brightness is diffuse light spread across the field of view of the camera. See :numref:`fig-healpix-map`.
  
   * Sky brightness includes components from emission from the atmosphere,  scattered light from various source (the Moon, Sun, etc.), and Zodiacal light.
   * Sky brightness varies smoothly over the sky, except near the moon.
   * Sky brightness varies slowly with time, except when the moon is rising or setting.

#. The Rubin Observatory scheduler requires an estimate of the foreground sky brightness over the visible sky at each time for which it schedules exposures.
     
   * The limiting magnitude (which depends on sky brightness) is one of the "features" the feature-based scheduler uses to order candidate exposures.
   * When Poisson noise from the sky background is the dominante source of noise, the error in limiting magnitude due to an error in sky brightness (in magnitudes/asec^2) is half the error in sky brightness. For example, an uncertainty of 0.2 magnitudes in sky brightness corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.1 magnitudes is limiting magnitude.
       
#. The current version of the scheduler uses a lookup table of sky values.

   * The Rubin Obs. scheduler looks up sky brightness values in a set of healpix_ (nside=32) sky maps, for each of the six filters, at 5 to 15 minute timesteps from 2022-09-01 to 2037-09-04 (excluding daytime). These healpix_ maps are created using skycalc_.
   * skycalc_ is a sky brightness model written for the exposure time calculator used by the European Southern Observatoryâ€™s (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal.
   * skycalc_ estimates the sky brightness in each Rubin Observatory filter by integrating the modeled SED over the corresponding instrument transmission curves.
   * The full set of healpix_ maps occupy 144 GiB of disk space.

#. Approximations of the sky brightness maps can be saved compactly using a Zernike transform.
   
   * Zernike polynomials form a set of othrogonal basis functions on the unit disk. See :numref:`fig-zernike-z`.
   * Low order terms of a Zerinke transform can approximate smoothly varying functions over the unit disk.
   * Residuals between the skycalc_ healpix maps and their approximation with a 6th order (27 term) Zernike approximation have a standard deviation of between 0.01 and 0.0X in all bands, much less than the standard deviation of the residuals between the skycalc_ model and the observed sky: uncertainty in the residuals are not significant compared to the uncertainty of :math:`\sim 0.2` in the model itself.
   * The residuals do not follow a normal distribution; the distribution has narrow tails extending from -0.22 magnitudes to 0.12 magintudes. See rb:numref:`fig-resid-full`.
   * The extreme tails in the residuals occurr near the moon, when the moon is itself at high airmass. See :numref:`fig-resid-worst`, :numref:`fig-moon-sep-hist`, and :numref:`fig-moon-alt-hist`.

#. The ``lsst.sims.sky_brightness_pre.zernike`` python module provides an interface for use of Zernike coefficients to store sky brightness.

   * This module uses coefficients stored in an ``hdf5`` file with a size of 294MiB (for coefficints up to 6th order).
   * This module interpolates Zernike coefficients for times not exactly covered by the original set of healpix maps.
   * This module provides an API similar to that of ``lsst.sims.sky_brightness_pre.SkyModelPre``, but does not include options no longer needed by current versions of the scheduler.

Overview
========

The Rubin Observatory scheduler uses the expected depth (limiting magnitude) of potential exposures as one of the fundamental features it uses to select among candidates.
One of the primary factors in calculating this depth is the sky brightness: diffuse light not orginating in any object the survey is interested in including in its catalog. 
The present (November, 2020) version of the scheduler estimates skybrightness values using the ESO skycalc_ sky brightness estimator. 
Computing values using the skycalc_ software is sufficiently cumbersome that, rather than calculate sky brightness estimates at the time they are needed, the scheduler development team pre-calculates and caches all sky values that might be needed over the course of the survey.
These pre-computed values are currently stored in Healpix_ maps with nside=32, sampled every 5 to 15 minutes.
This format results in a set of files that are inconveniently large: 144GiB all told.
Sky brightness typically varies smoothly, both over the sky and over time.
Rather than store values for full healpix maps, significant storage space can be saved by saving the coefficients for a Zernike polynomial tha approximates the sky values to be cached.
After giving a brief overview of the sky brightness estimate itself, this note describes an implementation of such an approximation, and examines its implications for disk space required, time taken to provide the scheduler sky values, and precision with whith the skycalc_ values are approximated. 

Sky value estimation
====================

The "sky brightness" consists of diffuse light from (mostly) foreground sources, spread smoothly across the detector.
The primary contributing sources include airglow, moon and starlight scattered off of particles in the Earth's atmosphere, and Zodiacal light (sunlight scattered off of interplanetary dust in the disk of the solar system).
ESO's skycalc_ software estimates the full spectral energy distribution of the sky brightness using physical models, including light singly and multiply scattered though Mie and Rayleigh scattering.

To prepare the arrays of pre-computed sky brightness values, the scheduling team integrates skycalc-generated spectra over each of the Rubin Observatory bandpasses, for each (nside=32) healpixel, in each 5 to 15 minute interval in survey schedule.
The resultant data-set is divided by date into a set of files totaling 144GiB. 
When a sky brightness value (or set of values) is needed by the scheduler, it reads the file for the relevant date range from disk (if it is not already loaded) and looks up the value (or values).

:numref:`fig-healpix-map` shows extreme examples of such sky brightness maps.
The left map shows a full dark sky (no moon or twilight). The dominant source of light in such a dark sky is airglow, which is dependent only on airmass.
The map therefore shows near radial symmetry about the zenith. The other extreme is sky with a full moon at moderate airmass.
Some radial dependence remains, but it is dominated by a gradient across the sky (in the sample in the figure, from left to right), and high brightnees about the moon itself.

.. _label: fig-healpix-map
.. figure:: /_static/healpix_map.png
   :name: fig-healpix-map

   Sky brightness maps of the sky brightness as stored in the cached healpix map files, generated using skycalc_.
   The color scales are in units of :math:`\frac{\textrm{mag}}{\textrm{asec}^2}`.
   The maps are in horizon coordinates: the center of each map is the zenith, and the radial coordinate the angle with zenith (with a maximum zenith distance of :math:`69^{\circ}`).

In both cases, the sky brightness varies smoothly.
The sharpent variation occurrs where the sky is brightest: near the moon, and just above the maximum airmass: locations on the sky the scheduler will avoid anyway.
Furthermore, tests of the skycalc_ model reported in FIXME 2013A%26A...560A..91J show a standard deviation between the model and measured values of 0.2 :math:`\frac{\textrm{mag}}{\textrm{asec}^2}` or greater, indicating that there is little to be gained from storing model values to high precision. These considerations suggest that the full, high-resolution healpix map is unnecessary, and that a smooth approximation will be adequate.

Zernike polynomials
===================

As approximations of smoothly varying functions on the unit disk that show significant radial symmetry, Zernike coefficients are a promising candidate.
Zernike polynomials form a set of orthogonal basis functions on the unit disk.
This use of Zernike polynomials is directly analogous to simple Fourier-transform based lossy image compression techniques, but is more naturally applied to the unit disk, and particulary suitable for functions with rotational symmetry. In the simplest applications, the transform can be truncated to include only lower order terms. Such a truncation has the effect of blurring the image. In more sophisticated applications, terms near zero can be set to zero and the result compressed. The same approaches can be applied using the Zernike transform as well. Because the "image" being compressed is smoothly varying, only a simple truncation is explored her ( although the more sophisticated approach may be useful).

There are several convertions for indexing and normalizing Zernike polynomials. Those used here are from FIXME Thebos 2002:

.. math::
   Z^{m}_n(\rho,\phi) = \begin{cases}
                                  N^m_n \times R^m_n(\rho) \times \cos(m \phi) & m \ge 0 \\
				  -N^m_n \times R^m_n(\rho) \times \sin(m \phi) & m \lt 0 \\
                           \end{cases}

where


.. math::
   N^m_n = \sqrt{\frac{2(n+1)}{1+\delta_{m0}}}

and

.. math::
   R^m_n(\rho) = \sum_{s=0}^{\frac{n-m}{2}} \frac{(-1)^k\,(n-s)!}{
   k!
   \left ( \frac{1}{2}[n + |m| - s] \right )!
   \left ( \frac{1}{2}[n - |m| - s] \right )!
   }
   \rho^{n-2s}

Here, :math:`\delta` is the Kroneker delta, :math:`m` is the angular frequency of the term, and :math:`n` the radial order. For a given radial order `n`, the angular frequency can have values :math:`-n, -n+2, -n+4, ..., n`. For the purposes of storing values and coefficients in a single dimensional array, it is convenient to define a single index, the mode number:

.. math::
   j = \frac{n(n+2) + m}{2}


Zernike coefficients that fit a function on the unit disk (the values of the Zernike transform of the function) are then:

.. math::
   F(\rho, \phi) = \sum_{m,n}\left[ a_{m,n}\ Z^{m}_n(\rho,\phi) + b_{m,n}\ Z^{-m}_n(\rho,\phi) \right]

:numref:`fig-zernike-z` shows :math:`Z^{m}_n(\rho,\phi)` graphically, and provides some intuition for the kinds of furctions low order Zernike coefficients can effectively represent.

.. _label: fig-zernike-z

   :name: fig-zernike-z

   The Zernike polyniomials, :math:`Z^{m}_n(\rho,\phi)`, for :math:`n<7`. The number to the upper left of each subplot shows the mode number, :math:`j` (the single-valued index).


Zernike approximations of sky brightness
========================================

The Rubin Observatory team produced a collection of nside=32 healpix maps at 5 minute incruments from MJD 59823 (2022-09-01) through MJD 65305 (2037-09-04).
To test the effectiveness of approximating skycalc_ sky brightness maps using truncated Zernike transforms, I fit Zernike coefficents through the 5th (21 terms), 6th (27 terms), and 11th orders (78 terms) orders to each of these sampled time steps.
Masked values in the healpix maps (around the zenith and moon) results in an unevently sampled starting data set, so a least squares fit was used to derive the coefficients rather than a traditional sum of products. 

:numref:`fig-resid-new` and :numref:`fig-resid-full` show typical skycalc_ maps, their 6th order (27 term) Zernike approximation, and residuals for dark (moon below the horizon) and bright (full moon above the horizon) sample times. The residuals show high-frequency patterns not representable by Zernike functions of this order; compare the lower left subplots of these figures with the basis functions in :numref:`fig-zernike-z`. 

.. _label: fig-resid-new
.. figure:: /_static/resid_new.png
   :name: fig-resid-new
	  
   The upper two pannels show the skycalc_ sky brightness for a typical fully dark (no moon) time (in horizon coordinates, with zenith at the center) on the left, and the Zernike approximation of these values on the night.
   The lower left figure shows the difference between the skycalc_ sky brightness and its Zernike approximation, and the lower right histogram shows the distribution of these residuals, masking the :math:`20^{\circ}` around the moon.
	  
.. _label: fig-resid-full
.. figure:: /_static/resid_full.png
   :name: fig-resid-full
	  
   The subplots above have the same meaning as those in :numref:`fig-resid-new`, except for a time with a full moon above the horizon.

:numref:`fig-residual-hists` shows the histograms of the residualsfor each order tested, in each filter, for the first year of tested data.
The distribution is dominated by residuals :less than 0.05 magnitudes in all cases, but thin tails extend from :math:`\sim -0.3` to :math:`\sim 0.1`, accentuated by the log scale in the figure.
Recall that the standard deviation of the residuals of the skycalc_ model with respect to actual data is :math:`\sim 0.2`: instances where the the difference between the Zernike approximation and the skycalc_ value are comparable to the precision of the skycalc_ model are rare, but they exist.
   
.. _label: fig-residual-hists
.. figure:: /_static/residual_hists.png
   :name: fig-residual-hists

   Histograms of the skycalc_ - Zernike approximation residuals, on a log scale, for all filters and with Zernike approximations to 5th, 6th, as 11th order. Note the log scale covering 7 orders of magnitude: the disctribution is sharply peaked around 0.
	  
Examination of examples of time samples with bad residuals indicate conditions under which Zernike approximations perform most poorly.
:numref:`fig-resid-worst` shows the maps, residuals, and histogram of residuals for the worst timestep in the first year.
It occurs when the moon is at an altitude of :math:`\sim 20^{\circ}`, just outside the area covered by the map (which extends only to a zenith distance of :math:`67^{\circ}`).
The worst residuals occur at the same azimuth as the moon: just above the moon on the sky.
   
.. _label: fig-resid-worst
.. figure:: /_static/resid_worst.png
   :name: fig-resid-worst
	  
   The subplots above have the same meaning as those in :numref:`fig-resid-new`, except for the time with the worst residuals.

:numref:`fig-moon-sep-hist` and :numref:`fig-moon-alt-hist` indicate that this is typical of the worst time steps: they occurr when the moon has an altitude of :math:`\sim 20^{\circ}`, in sky within :math:`\sim 20^{\circ}` of the moon, and an altitude of less than :math:`\sim 40^{\circ}`.
	
.. _label: fig-moon-sep-hist
.. figure:: /_static/moon_sep_hist.png
   :name: fig-moon-sep-hist

   A 2-dimensional histogram of the sky estimates as a function of residual between skycalc_ magnitude and its Zernike approximation, and the angular separation between the point on the sky and the moon.
   The color is coded according to a log scale, covering 6 orders of magnitude. Note that the worst residuals are within :math:`20^{\circ}` of the moon.

.. _label: fig-moon-alt-hist
.. figure:: /_static/moon_alt_hist.png
   :name: fig-moon-alt-hist

   A 2-dimensional histogram of the sky estimates as a function of residual between skycalc_ magnitude and its Zernike approximation, and the altitude of the moon.. The color is coded according to a log scale, covering 6 orders of magnitude.
   Note that the worst residuals occur when the moon is at an altitude of about :math:`20^{\circ}`.

.. _label: fig-alt-hist
.. figure:: /_static/alt_hist.png
   :name: fig-alt-hist

   A 2-dimensional histogram of the sky estimates as a function of residual between skycalc_ magnitude and its Zernike approximation, and the altitude an the sky. The color is coded according to a log scale, covering 6 orders of magnitude.
   Note that the worst residuals occur at altitudes below :math:`40^{\circ}` (an airmass of about 1.6).

Although these histograms confirm that the very worst residuals occurr in situations similar to those shown in :numref:`fig-resid-worst`, they also show some residuals as bad as :math:`\sim 0.15` magnitudes occurr even in dark time. :numref:`fig-resid-worst-dark` shows the sample time with the worst residuals in dark time.
The "spike" of brightness at an azimuth of :math:`\sim90^{\circ}` is suggestive of zodiacal light, and indeed at this timestep is near twilight, with the sun azimuth near the area with high residuals (:math:`\mbox{az}=95^{\circ}`), as one would expect if this were zodiacal light.
   
.. _label: fig-resid-worst-dark
.. figure:: /_static/resid_worst_dark.png
   :name: fig-resid-worst-dark
	  
   The subplots above have the same meaning as those in :numref:`fig-resid-new`, except for the dark time (moon below the horizon) with the worst residuals.

If zodial light is the cause of all of the extreme dark time residuals, then one would expect these high residuals only to occurr at low ecliptic latitude, and indeed this is what :numref:`fig-dark-ecl-lat-hist` shows.

.. _label: fig-dark-ecl-lat-hist
.. figure:: /_static/dark_ecl_lat_hist.png
   :name: fig-dark-ecl-lat-hist

   A 2-dimensional histogram of the sky estimates as a function of residual between skycalc_ magnitude and its Zernike approximation, and the ecliptic latitude. The color is coded according to a log scale, covering 6 orders of magnitude.
   Note that the worst residuals occur at ecliptic latitudes close to 0.

   
Implementation
==============

The API used by the scheduler
-----------------------------

The Rubin Observatory scheduler calls its sky brightness estimator by passing a time (as a floating point MJD) and set of healpix coordinates, which returns a dictionary of ``numpy`` arrays of sky brightnes values.
The keys of this dictionary are the filters, and the values are arrays that hold the sky brightnes values (corresponding to the array of indices provided).

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import healpy
>>> from lsst.sims.skybrightness_pre import SkyModelPre
>>>
>>> mjd = 59854.3
>>> npix = 32
>>>
>>> ra1, decl1 = 0, -50
>>> pointing1 = healpy.ang2pix(npix, ra1, decl1, lonlat=True)
>>>
>>> ra2, decl2 = 0, -20
>>> pointing2 = healpy.ang2pix(npix, ra2, decl2, lonlat=True)
>>>
>>> healpix_idxs = np.array((pointing1, pointing2))
>>>
>>> sky_model_pre = SkyModelPre()
>>> sky_brightness = sky_model_pre.returnMags(mjd, healpix_idxs)
>>>
>>> print("Sky brightness in i at pointing 1:",  sky_brightness['i'][0])
Sky brightness in i at pointing 1: 20.211941485692027
>>> print("Sky brightness in g at pointing 2:",  sky_brightness['g'][1])
Sky brightness in g at pointing 2: 21.908871333901892

If no healpix ids are provided in the call to ``returnMags``, then the array of sky values over the whole sphere is returned, and the healpix ids are the indices of the array.

Computation from Zernike coefficients and polynomials
-----------------------------------------------------

To compute estimates of the sky brightness, the ``lsst.sims.skybrightness_pre.zernike.ZernikeSky`` class evaluates

.. math::
   F(t, \rho, \phi) = \sum_j c[j](t)\ Z[j](\rho,\phi)

:math:`t` represents the time (stored as an MJD), and :math:`\rho, \phi` the coordinates in the disk over which the Zernike polynomials are orthogonal.
As used in the ``ZernikeSky`` class, :math:`\phi` is the azimuthal angle in horizon coordinates, and :math:`\rho = \frac{\mathrm{zd}}{\mathrm{zd_{max}}}`, where zd is the angular zenith distance, and zd :sub:`max` the maximum zenith distance for which surface brightness is to be calculated.
      
The mode number, :math:`j`, is used here rather that the more traditional radial order and angular frequency indices (:math:`n, m`) to simplify storage in a ``pandas.DataFrame`` or ``numpy`` array.
The sum contains two components: the coefficients, :math:`c[j](t)`, and the values of the Zernike polynomial themselves, :math:`Z[j](\rho,\phi)`.
The values of the coefficients for a given mode number is a function only of time, not location on the sky, while the values of the Zernike polynomials (for a given mode number) are a function only of the location on the sky (in horizon coordinates).

To implement the API shown above, the implementation of the Zernike-based sky brightness code requires values of :math:`c[j]` at the ``mjd`` requested, and :math:`Z[j](\rho,\phi)` for each healpix index requested.

Estimation of Zernike coefficients :math:`c[j](t)`
--------------------------------------------------

The ``ZernikeSky.load_coeffs`` method reads values for the Zernike coefficients from an ``hdf5`` file into a ``pandas.DataFrame``, with columns for each Zernike mode number and rows for each time step fit, such that each row corresponds to a time at which the ``lsst.sims.skybrightness_pre.SkyModelPre`` stores a full healpix map.
Each (``nside=32``) healpix map contains 12288 values, while a row in the ``pandas.DataFrame`` of Zernike coefficients though a radial of 6 has 28 values, a factor of :math:`\sim 439` times more compact.


:numref:`fig-worst-coeff-vs-time` shows the variation in the values of the Zernike coeffients over time, over the course of a dynamic night.
At the end of evening twiling, the moon is below the horizon, but rises shortly thereafter.
The effect is particulary clean in the :math:`Z_0^0` term, in which the sky brightness drops sharply at the start of the night (evening twilight), briefly plateaus (the portion of the night during which the moon is below the horizon), the brightens as the moon rises.
Over the course of the night, the moon rises into the area covered by the sky approximation, transits, and begins to set.
It can be seen from the plots that the contribution of each Zernike polynomial drops as the radial order increases, with the lowest order terms having the most significant influence on the calculated sky brightness.
It can also be seen that, except at the precise time step at which the moon rises, the values of the coefficients vary smoothly with time relative to the sampling in time:  values of coefficients between points can be effectively estimated by simple linear interpolation.
This is what the ``lsst.sims.skybrightness_pre.zernike.ZernikeSky`` class does.

.. _label: fig-worst-coeff-vs-time
.. figure:: /_static/worst_coeff_vs_time.png
   :name: fig-worst-coeff-vs-time

   The values of the Zernike coefficients for a particularly dynamic night, in which the moon begins beneath the horizon and then rises and transits over the course of the night.
   The coefficients are scaled such that the values on the vertical axis represent the maximum change in magnitude contributed by each mode number.
   The heavy red points show the values for `i` band, while the fainter points in other colors represent other filters.

Estimation of Zernike polynomial values :math:`Z[j](\rho, \phi)`
----------------------------------------------------------------
   
While the coefficients themselves are functions of the time and independent of the location on the sky, the values of the Zernike polynomials of a given mode number are themselves are functions only of the location on the sky (in horizon coordinates).
Each :math:`Z_m^n(\rho, \phi)` term is the product of a polynomial in :math:`\rho` and a trigonometric fuction of :math:`\phi`, making it the most computationally expensive requirements for calculating the :math:`F(t, \rho, \phi)`.
The values, however, of :math:`Z_m^n(\rho, \phi)` do not change with time.
If we are making repeated calculations at specific values of :math:`\rho, \phi`, these values can be computed once and cached.
To fulfill the API, ``ZernikeSky`` must provide sky brightness values at a predefined set of coordinates, suggesting that that we can simply calculate :math:`Z_m^n` at these values, but there is a problem: the healpix coordinates in the argument are predefined in equatorial coordinates, but the values of :math:`Z_m^n` are constant in horizon coordinates.
The values of :math:`\rho, \phi` for the given set of healpix values are a function of the local Sidereal time (LST), so the values of :math:`Z_m^n` are as well.
   
.. _label: fig-Z-vs-LST
.. figure:: /_static/Z_vs_LST.png
   :name: fig-Z-vs-LST

   The variation of :math:`Z_m^n` as a function of LST for several sample equatorial healpixels at different declinations.
   (Variation in R.A. shifts the values horizontally, but does not affect the shape of the curves.)
   Sidereal times for which the curves have no values shown are time at which these pointings are at a zenith distance greater than the range of the Zerinke function.
   The lowest order functions (shown in the upper rows) correspond to Zernikes that have the greatest influence on the ultimate sky brightness estimate (see corresponding plots in :numref:`fig-worst-coeff-vs-time`), have Zernike polynomials that vary most smoothly over the sky (:numref:`fig-zernike-z`), and have the smoothest behavior in this plot. 

Rather than calculate :math:`Z_m^n(\rho, \phi)` "from scratch" for each healpix at the time requested, ``ZernikeSky`` pre-computes ``Z[j][hpix]`` at a sequences of LST values for each Zernike mode number and equatorial healpixel, and interpolates to obtain the value of ``Z[j][hpix]`` at the LST corresponding to the MJD with which it is called.
The inset in the upper left of :numref:`fig-Z-vs-LST` shows sampled points for five different healpixels and different declinations. 

Computing sky brightness with ``ZernikeSky``
--------------------------------------------

To calculate the sky brightness using an API that following that used by the scheduler:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import healpy
>>> from lsst.sims.skybrightness_pre.zernike import SkyModelZernike
>>>
>>> mjd = 59854.3
>>> npix = 32
>>>
>>> ra1, decl1 = 0, -50
>>> pointing1 = healpy.ang2pix(npix, ra1, decl1, lonlat=True)
>>>
>>> ra2, decl2 = 0, -20
>>> pointing2 = healpy.ang2pix(npix, ra2, decl2, lonlat=True)
>>>
>>> healpix_idxs = np.array((pointing1, pointing2))
>>>
>>> sky_model = SkyModelZernike()
>>> sky_brightness = sky_model.returnMags(mjd, healpix_idxs)
>>>
>>> print("Sky brightness in i at pointing 1:",  sky_brightness['i'][0])
Sky brightness in i at pointing 1: 20.240004108584117
>>> print("Sky brightness in g at pointing 2:",  sky_brightness['g'][1])
Sky brightness in g at pointing 2: 21.967150461105156

This example relies on finding the ``hdf`` file with the Zernike coefficients in ``${SIMS_SKYBRIGHTNESS_DATA}/zernike/zernike.h5``.
If it is located elsewhere, the first argument in the instantiation of ``SkyModelZernike`` should be the path to this file.
